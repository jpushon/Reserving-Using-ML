# Claims Reserving using Machine Learning

My attempt at a **curated** list of articles and research around the application of Machine Learning methods in a Claims Reserving context. 

## General Scene setting
[Comparison of Traditional and Machine Learning Methodologies](https://www.casact.org/research/wp/papers/working-paper-virgilis-cerqueti-2020-01.pdf) - Looks at granular claim level estimation techniques, includes overview of techniques and a case study.

[Machine learning in GI Reserving](https://www.actuaries.org.uk/system/files/field/document/IFoA_ML_Reserving_V0.pdf) - High level overview of Machine Learning in Reserving noting some influential papers. 


[Machine learning in Reserving Working Party - UK survey findings](https://www.actuaries.org.uk/system/files/field/document/MLR_UKSurveyIFoA.pdf) - High level overview of Machine Learning in Reserving across surveyed companies in the UK. 

[Survey of Canadian Actuarieson ML in Reserving](https://www.actuaries.org.uk/system/files/field/document/MLR_CanadaSurvey.pdf) - High level overview of Machine Learning in Reserving across surveyed companies in Canada.


## Deep Learning / Neural Networks
[Artificial Neural Networks in Insurance Loss Reserving](https://www.atlantis-press.com/proceedings/jcis2006/67) - Brief paper looking at GLMs and NNs.

[Deep Triangle](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.09253.pdf) - The approach allows for joint modeling of paid losses and claims outstanding, and incorporation of heterogeneous input. Uses high level aggregated data.

## GLMs

## Statistical Case Estimates

[Statisical Case Estimation](https://fbe.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/2592072/104.pdf) - Focus on long tailed claims with multiple payment types, and estimating timing and pattern of cashflows. Appears less relevant to estimating short-tailed ultimates at a claim-level.
